Support files for running shock and vibration tests.

In order to create an SD card that autoruns the testsuite at startup perform
the following steps on an SD card with the ADI image on it:

  - Patch the devicetree to export the AXI_GPREG memory range.
  	(see zynq-picozed-sdr1-brk.dts.patch)

  - Patch osc to support running tests in Xvfb on the command line.
  	(see osc-cli-test.patch)

  - Copy loopback.c and test_pzsdr_vibration.sh to /root.

  - Compile loopback.c in /root
    (gcc loopback.c -o loopback)

  - Add a call to /root/test_pzsdr_vibration.sh right before the exit line in
	/etc/rc.local.

On reboot, the script should run the loopback tests and then the osc tests in
succession, over and over again, sending log output to /root/log.txt until a
failure occurs. On failure, the LEDs should be flashing.
