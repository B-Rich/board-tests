Breakout board specific test suite.

In order to create an SD card that autoruns the testsuite at startup perform
the following steps on an SD card with the ADI image on it:

  - Make sure evtest is installed on the SD card.
    (sudo apt-get install evtest)

  - Make sure a new enough devicetree is being used that maps all the buttons
    and switches to separate events.

  - Copy runtests.sh to /root.

  - After boot up, connect to the device over UART and run ./runtests.sh from
    the command line.
