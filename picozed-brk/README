Breakout board specific test suite.

To create an SD card that autoruns the U-Boot-based testsuite via a remote RPi
at startup perform the following steps on an SD card with the lite version of
this raspian image necessary to drive the connected LCD screen [1]:

  - Install picocom and the python2.7 packages for blessings, pyserial, and
    pexpect. Note that some of those python packages might not be in the
    available package repos so you'll have to bootstrap pip and use that to
    install the python packages. To bootstrap pip use the get-pip.py script
    and info at https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/.

  - Clone https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/board-tests.git into /home/pi.

  - Add the following lines to /etc/rc.local before the "exit 0" line at the
    end to run the test script on boot:

    clear
    /home/pi/board-tests/picozed-brk/pexpect-uboot

To create an SD card that autoruns the old Linux-based testsuite at startup
perform the following steps on an SD card with the ADI image on it:

  - Make sure to remove all gpio_keys mappings from the device tree in order
    to be able to export push button and switch gpios.

  - Copy runtests.sh to /root.

  - Add a call to /root/runtests.sh in /etc/rc.local to run the test suite
    automatically on boot.
