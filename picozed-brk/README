Breakout board specific test suite.

In order to create an SD card that autoruns the testsuite at startup perform
the following steps on an SD card with the ADI image on it:

  - Make sure to remove all gpio_keys mappings from the device tree in order
    to be able to export push button and switch gpios.

  - Copy runtests.sh to /root.

  - Add a call to /root/runtests.sh in /etc/rc.local to run the test suite
    automatically on boot.
