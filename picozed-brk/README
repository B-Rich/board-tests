Breakout board specific test suite.

To create an SD card that autoruns the u-boot-based testsuite via a remote RPi
at startup perform the following steps on an SD card with the lite version of
this raspian image necessary to drive the connected LCD screen [1]:

  - Clone https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/board-tests.git into /home/pi.

  - Add the following lines to /etc/rc.local before the "exit 0" line at the
    end to run the test script on boot:

To create an SD card that autoruns the old linux-based testsuite at startup
perform the following steps on an SD card with the ADI image on it:

  - Make sure to remove all gpio_keys mappings from the device tree in order
    to be able to export push button and switch gpios.

  - Copy runtests.sh to /root.

  - Add a call to /root/runtests.sh in /etc/rc.local to run the test suite
    automatically on boot.
